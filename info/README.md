## Description
_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Teaches Typing_ is yet another new edition in the _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ series, focusing on a retelling of five (kind of) mythological punishments. In _Teaches Typing_ you learn to type in this helpfully Sisyphean environment. It's like Mavis Beacon, but in Hades.
