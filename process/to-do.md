# Sisyphus

- Implement basic "type this text" (display the text, scroll it, highlight as it gets typed)
- Implement WPM (display this on screen)
- Make Sisyphus animate a push while WPM is up, and pause/slip when not
- Consider the question of what happens to text/typing when he fails explicitly at the top
