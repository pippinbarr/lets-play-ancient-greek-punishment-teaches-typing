# Sisyphus

- ~~Implement basic "type this text" (display the text, scroll it, highlight as it gets typed)~~
- ~~Implement WPM (display this on screen)~~
- ~~Make Sisyphus animate a push while WPM is up, and pause/slip when not~~
- ~~__CANNOT INTERACT UNTIL HE'S BACK AT THE BOTTOM__ Consider the question of what happens to text/typing when he fails explicitly at the top~~
- ~~Add failures text/stat~~
- ~~__GETTING THERE?__ Improve WPM calculation (notably it needs to fall automatically if you don't type!)~~
- ~~Consider OO to create a Typing Scene for the game to avoid just cutting and pasting the typing stuff, but also maybe not? We'll see.~~

- Consider issue of difficulty levels to give appropriate challenge (any bonus to doing the harder levels? Safety instructions thing? of different texts? Too exhausting to think about? Perhaps not? Repetition > Narrative > Markov?)
- What is the text going to be???
