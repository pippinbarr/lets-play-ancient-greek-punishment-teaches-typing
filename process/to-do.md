# Menu

- ~~Basic menu~~
- ~~Implement difficulty selection menu prior to actually loading the level in question (maybe keep it all in the main menu. just with new options to choose from and have a mode? Or not.)~~

# Sisyphus

- ~~Implement basic "type this text" (display the text, scroll it, highlight as it gets typed)~~
- ~~Implement WPM (display this on screen)~~
- ~~Make Sisyphus animate a push while WPM is up, and pause/slip when not~~
- ~~__CANNOT INTERACT UNTIL HE'S BACK AT THE BOTTOM__ Consider the question of what happens to text/typing when he fails explicitly at the top~~
- ~~Add failures text/stat~~
- ~~__GETTING THERE?__ Improve WPM calculation (notably it needs to fall automatically if you don't type!)~~
- ~~Consider OO to create a Typing Scene for the game to avoid just cutting and pasting the typing stuff, but also maybe not? We'll see.~~
- ~~Consider issue of difficulty levels to give appropriate challenge (any bonus to doing the harder levels? Safety instructions thing? of different texts? Too exhausting to think about? Perhaps not? Repetition > Narrative > Markov?)~~
- ~~What is the text going to be???~~
- ~~Implement beginner text with Tracery of fundamentally describing the action (simple words)~~
- ~~Implement intermediate text with "writing lines" flavour referring to the actions that brough the character to Hades~~
- ~~__DID A VERSION WITH CAMUS FOR NOW__ Implement advanced text with Markov chain drawing on existing texts about the character (and perhaps other stuff too where plausible? This one still needs a bit of thought, but I think can be surreal and weird. Alternatively this could be a monologue somehow.)~~
- ~~Sit back and contemplate your texts~~
- ~~__I WILL__ Maybe transition the beginner text to literally repeating a single word or phrase?~~
- ~~Change beginner to single words, verbs in strings~~
- ~~__IT FEELS QUITE GOOD__ Change advanced to "Hill" and see how it feels to type it in (will need to clean up the text etc.)~~
- ~~Consider the feedback around mistyping and around when the game is autopiloting (boulder rolling back down the hill)~~
- ~~Add SFX~~
- ~~Send to J+M and Rilla~~
- ~~Lower the WPM requirements (20 for beginner, 50 for intermediate, 80 for advanced?)~~
- ~~Remove Failures~~
