# Sisyphus

- ~~Implement basic "type this text" (display the text, scroll it, highlight as it gets typed)~~
- ~~Implement WPM (display this on screen)~~
- ~~Make Sisyphus animate a push while WPM is up, and pause/slip when not~~

- Consider the question of what happens to text/typing when he fails explicitly at the top
- Add failures text/stat
- Improve WPM calculation (notably it needs to fall automatically if you don't type!)
- Consider OO to create a Typing Scene for the game to avoid just cutting and pasting the typing stuff, but also maybe not? We'll see.
- What is the text going to be???
