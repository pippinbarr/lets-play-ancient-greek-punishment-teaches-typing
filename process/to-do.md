# Menu

- ~~Basic menu~~
- ~~Implement difficulty selection menu prior to actually loading the level in question (maybe keep it all in the main menu. just with new options to choose from and have a mode? Or not.)~~

# Sisyphus

- ~~Implement basic "type this text" (display the text, scroll it, highlight as it gets typed)~~
- ~~Implement WPM (display this on screen)~~
- ~~Make Sisyphus animate a push while WPM is up, and pause/slip when not~~
- ~~__CANNOT INTERACT UNTIL HE'S BACK AT THE BOTTOM__ Consider the question of what happens to text/typing when he fails explicitly at the top~~
- ~~Add failures text/stat~~
- ~~__GETTING THERE?__ Improve WPM calculation (notably it needs to fall automatically if you don't type!)~~
- ~~Consider OO to create a Typing Scene for the game to avoid just cutting and pasting the typing stuff, but also maybe not? We'll see.~~
- ~~Consider issue of difficulty levels to give appropriate challenge (any bonus to doing the harder levels? Safety instructions thing? of different texts? Too exhausting to think about? Perhaps not? Repetition > Narrative > Markov?)~~
- ~~What is the text going to be???~~
- ~~Implement beginner text with Tracery of fundamentally describing the action (simple words)~~
- ~~Implement intermediate text with "writing lines" flavour referring to the actions that brough the character to Hades~~
- ~~__DID A VERSION WITH CAMUS FOR NOW__ Implement advanced text with Markov chain drawing on existing texts about the character (and perhaps other stuff too where plausible? This one still needs a bit of thought, but I think can be surreal and weird. Alternatively this could be a monologue somehow.)~~
- ~~Sit back and contemplate your texts~~
- ~~__I WILL__ Maybe transition the beginner text to literally repeating a single word or phrase?~~
- ~~Change beginner to single words, verbs in strings~~
- ~~__IT FEELS QUITE GOOD__ Change advanced to "Hill" and see how it feels to type it in (will need to clean up the text etc.)~~
- ~~Consider the feedback around mistyping and around when the game is autopiloting (boulder rolling back down the hill)~~
- ~~Add SFX~~
- ~~Send to J+M and Rilla~~
- ~~Lower the WPM requirements (20 for beginner, 50 for intermediate, 80 for advanced?)~~
- ~~Remove Failures~~

# Prometheus

- ~~Implement the basics~~
- ~~Add the appropriate texts~~

# Tantalus

- ~~Implement the basics~~
- ~~Add the appropriate texts~~
- ~~Think about the "I will not" conflict (between the two - it's not the end of the world of course, but does mean you have no idea which is which for the very first typing sequence and have to randomly pick one, which kind of sucks for the player if they pick the "wrong" one...)~~
- ~~__I DECREE THAT IT IS FUNNY AND IT WORKS__ Should one be all upper case and one all lower case to consistent avoid the problem? Pretty awkward... (but it's kind of funny just this once? Uppercase being the apple and lower case being the water... kind of directly relevant?)~~
- ~~Think about the error sound problem (every correct character for one is incorrect for the other)~~

# Danaids

- ~~Implement the basics~~
- ~~Add the appropriate texts~~
- ~~Disable typing while pouring into the bath for a comic pause~~

# Zeno

- ~~Implement the basics~~
- ~~Add the appropriate texts~~
- ~~Add changing half-way texts (including "half-way and almost half-way" or whatever it is when it loses precision)~~
- ~~Add "Half way there!" encouragement~~
- ~~Increase movement and animation speed with decreased distances~~

# Camus

- ~~Sketch Camus scene~~
- ~~Think about failure animation~~
- ~~Get text working~~
- ~~Get basic failure working~~
- ~~Get reset from failure working~~
- ~~Force failure if they make it through? No, just repeat the text ha ha ha ha!~~
- ~~Maybe on completing the document it goes in the trash ha ha ha ha~~
- ~~SFX for page completion (victory? Or even book completion...)~~
- ~~Re-add difficulty selection for Camus but make it only "NIGHTMARE"~~
- ~~Implement unlock of Camus (including explainer text)~~

# General

- ~~Remove all non-typeable characters from texts~~

# Testing

- Send to J+M
- Send to Jhave
- Send to Jess

# Mobile?

- ~~Fuck no?~~

# Bugs

- ~~Highlighting the wrong fucking letter!~~
- ~~__SEEMS LIKE INCLUDING THE PRELOADER SCREEN FIXES IT?__ Doesn't run in Firefox???~~
- ~~__JUST REPLACED THEM ALL WITH PERIODS AND LET'S PRAY__ Mis-replaced stuff in Danaids so there's a $1 at the end of every sentence!~~
