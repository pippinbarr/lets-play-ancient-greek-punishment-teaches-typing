_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Teaches Typing_ is another edition in the _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ series begun in 2011 and comprising: [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayancientgreekpunishment/LetsPlayAncientGreekPunishment.html) (2011), [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Art Edition Edition](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayletsplayancientgreekpunishmentarteditionedition/) (2015), [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Limited Edition](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayancientgreekpunishmentlimitededition/) (2016), [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: CPU Edition](http://pippinbarr.github.io/letsplayancientgreekpunishmentcpuedition/) (2017), [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Inversion Edition](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-inversion-edition) (2019), [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: UI Edition](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-ui-edition) (2019). In _Teaches Typing_ we return to the original style of pixel art but with the player's typing speed determining their interaction with the game. Typing quickly, consistently, and accurately enough allows them to proceed with the punishment in question, whether it's pushing a boulder uphill as Sisyphus or reaching for an apple as Tantalus. Each game has three difficulty levels which present different texts to type in. There's even a bonus Albert Camus level!

## History

The _Teaches Typing_ version came up essentially as part of my response to the birth of my son Felix. Once he was born I realised that I was fundamentally going to need game projects that would be fairly easy to conceptualise and execute, while still providing me with enough design interest to be worthwhile. I sat down and came up with around ten variations on the _Ancient Greek Punishment_ series, figuring that I could just spend the year making and remaking the "same game" over and over in different versions. So far so good! If you want some beard-stroking style meditations on the game and what it means, see the [process journal](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-teaches-typing/blob/master/process/process-journal.md) or the [research questions](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-teaches-typing/blob/master/process/research-questions.md).

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Teaches Typing_ is also a continuation of my project to apply the game development documentation approach I've been working on with my colleagues Rilla Khaled and Jonathan Lessard. We've come to call this approach the [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma) (for me it stands for _Method for Design Materialisation and Analysis_) and it forms a fundamental part of our [Games as Research](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project. So, if you want to, you can read a lot about the game's development by reading its [process documentation](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-teaches-typing/blob/master/process/README.md) and by going through its [commit history](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-teaches-typing/commits/master).

## Technology

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Teaches Typing_ was created in JavaScript using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/). The Advanced texts in the game come from Wikipedia. The text in the Camus level comes from Albert Camus's essay _The Myth of Sisyphus_.
